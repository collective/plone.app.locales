Certain caching operations, when mapped, can be used to place entire pages into the RAM cache. Using the RAM cache may allow you to gain some speed (and reduce CPU usage), at the cost of using more memory. Note that the default RAM cache is shared among threads in the same Zope instance, but is not shared between Zope instances. Thus, if you are running a multi-instance ZEO setup, you may find it more efficient to segment your users using a front-end load balancer so that they always reach the same back-end instance.
